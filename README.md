# micro-solenoid_geometry_optimization

## About
The class file solenoidcoil.m optimizes the geometry of a micro-solenoid to provide the maximum SNR for Magnetic resonance microscopy expeirments. It takes various input of a micro-solenoid coil geometry such as: number of turns, coil diameter, wire diameter, conductivity of the wire,  and length of the lead wires. The other inputs are the sample length, sample diameter, temperature of the coil, and temperature of the sample.
